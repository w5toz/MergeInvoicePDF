This is a simple PDF merging tool developed for the specific task of merging (invoice) PDF files (only tested with Chinese format invoice PDFs). It generates two types of merged files: the first type merges files in pairs, combining multiple PDF invoices two by two onto A4 format PDF pages; the second type sequentially merges multiple PDF files together, with each page of the original PDFs being resized to A4 format.
